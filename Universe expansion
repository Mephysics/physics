What if expansion of universe stops suddenly or at once,
Let me take an example:-
                        If you through the ball at a velocity
Of 23|M|S|N so, According to newton's law that every action 
Has an equal and opposite reaction so if you through the ball
On a wall at a velocity of 23|M|S|N, so it will automatically 
through the ball in its opposite direction if ball is thrown 
at 23|M|S|S

So, In case of universe if it suddenly stop expanding.So,there
would be throw back with equal speed and opposite direction.
So, there are two possibilities. 1st is that it will shrink back
2nd is that it will create a black hole due to collision of stars 
And the black hole will absorb the mass around it So, nor the universe
Will expand nor it will shrink. THIS IS JUST AN HYPOTHETICAL THEORY SO IT MIGHT BE WRONG
